## About The Project

This project was built to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for small business owners to manage their day-to-day finances. It replaces manual record-keeping with a secure, cloud-based solution that can be accessed from any device. The application was originally built with local HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and was later migrated to a full-stack application using Supabase for the database and authentication, and Vercel for deployment.
